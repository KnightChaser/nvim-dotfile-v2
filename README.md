# `nvim-dotfile-v2`
My custom neovim configuration based on Lazy.nvim, version 2.

**Motivation**: The [previous version(`nvim-dotfile-v1`)](git@github.com:KnightChaser/nvim-dotfile-v1.git) was my first Neovim configuration file that I had built since I first said hello to Neovim. However, because of this, the configuration was unstable and error-prone, and for sure there are a bunch of things I don't use. So I decided to recreate the configuration from the scratch.

**Necessary Linux packages for this Neovim setup**
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y curl ripgrep fd-find
```
